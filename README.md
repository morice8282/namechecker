# namechecker
A python script that checks if 4 letter Names are available or taken with the mojang api

if u havenÂ´t done it u need to open a Terminal and execute
pip install requests and then run it with 
python checker.py in a Terminal

right it checks on Username every 1.5 seconds but u can change it at
 time.sleep(1.5) but i wouldnt recommend it because of the rate limit but u can get a available Name
 really fast
